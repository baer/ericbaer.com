          <p>
            The decision to change your underlying technologies is so critical
            to how teams function that it is essential to have buy-in from
            everybody at the table - not just developers.
          </p>

            This book is not to teach you React; there are many excellent
            resources for that. Instead, its goal is to help to explain some of
            Reactâ€™s core innovations with as little jargon as possible to help
            bring a more diverse set of interests into conversations about
            technology.
